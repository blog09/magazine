<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look Up Words in Reference Books or On the Internet</h2>
<p>It's never too late to learn a language or try to enhance your writing or speaking skills! Start by looking online or in a dictionary to find out what definitions are available and whether any synonyms might work better in the situation where you're using the word.</p>
<p>You might also find helpful ways to use the word in context. This can help you to feel more confident using the word. It's always a good idea to look words up that you aren't familiar with. This habit will only make you a more informed and interesting writer.</p>
<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Your Own Experiences as Inspiration for Writing</h2>
<p>Share your stories with others through your writing. It's important to read and research so that you can create interesting and descriptive sentences, but it's equally important to write about what you know best.</p>
<p>Once you've cooked a meal, see a movie, played a sport, or written an essay about your life experiences and what you've learned from them you can use those memories to help inspire the story you're working on.</p>
<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn More About Appreciation and Empathy</h2>
<p>To develop more empathy for others in your writing, it's important to learn about other people's feelings. To get an idea of what words to use when speaking or writing about someone else's feelings, read blogs or books that are full of stories that are written by someone else.</p>
<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Master Compound Words</h2>
<p>Compound words are words that contain two or more separate words that together makeup one word. For example, congratulation is a compound word. It contains two separate words: congratulate andendorse. These will help you to create interesting and memorable sentences and paragraphs.</p>
<h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understand The Purpose of Your Writing</h2>
<p>When you are writing any kind of piece of creative work, it's important to understand the message that your piece intends to convey. If you're writing about a work trip, how do you want your readers to feel after reading it? If you're writing an essay on a political topic, what is the point of your essay? Knowing this can help you in the creation of an engaging piece that will have an impact.</p>
