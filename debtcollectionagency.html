<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Your debt collection agency will have access to sensitive customer data.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Different debt collection agencies offer various pricing structures.

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Legal Expertise</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In some cases, legal action may be necessary to recover debts.
